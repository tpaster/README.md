Hi, I'm Terra. I am a Master's student at ASU for Computer Science. Other than pursuing my degree I am an independent
software engineer with various programs on display in my portfolio. 

When I am not coding I enjoy meditating :lotus_position_woman:, spending time in nature :deciduous_tree:, and reading :closed_book:.
